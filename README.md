# Soled Out Shoes, Shopping Application
This application features a mock shoe website. With the use of Vue.js, I'm able to create a user interface alongside Node.js and Express.js in order to utilize a database of shoes and data. A user may “purchase” or view a selection of products provided by a database. I am able to utilize a ‘store’ to keep our variables available to other components who may need them or need to update them. Receipts can be printed using an API that allows the user to print the final product price onto a PDF while maintaining table structure and layout, to resemble a receipt.
